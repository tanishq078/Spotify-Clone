This Spotify clone is a dynamic web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to emulate the core functionalities of Spotify. It features advanced DOM manipulation for interactive UI updates, asynchronous functions for smooth data fetching and audio playback, and the Fetch API for retrieving music data. Event handling ensures responsive controls for playing, pausing, and navigating tracks, while pure CSS provides a sleek, responsive design. This project is hosted on webhostmost.com, allowing it to be accessible online, demonstrating a comprehensive application of modern web development techniques.
Special credit goes to @codewithharry, whose project tutorial was instrumental in creating this clone.
